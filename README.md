Word Press Tips and Plugin Recommendations

#### Plugin Recommendations
- All In One WP Security: WordPress is so well known, so hackers love to try to take it down. This plugin will help keep the site secure from hackers.
- Contact Form 7: if you want to give people a form to send you an email, this is it.
- Flamingo: keep track of all of your contacts (who have sent you stuff via Contact Form 7)
- MailChimp for WordPress: allow users to sign up for a mail chimp mailing list
- Members: role and user management
- The Events Calendar: create your own calendar (pay for PRO version to get the cool widgets and recurring events). The calendar supports iCal format, which can be pulled into a google calendar.
